*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed
together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on
a conceptual level. In this challenge we’ll study a simple problem of
structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of
sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won’t have
to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering
the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this
challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What
sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

*Background*: The
[strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a
material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before
breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an
object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a
solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material,
internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can
survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge’s
data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate
tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy.
The experiments were carried out following the higest standards of
experimental rigor, so you should consider these values to be the “true”
breaking strength for each sample.

**Observations**:

- What is the mean strength of the material, approximately?
  - The mean strength of the material is approximately 40000 psi.
- To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data
  has?
  - It is hard to tell the shape of the distribution of the data, but it
    appears to be centered around 40000 psi.
- Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from
  this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?
  - The observed variability is real since we are considering this the
    true breaking strength of each individual sample.

# Assessing Structural Safety

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and
assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a
more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and
determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering
a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A
larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load
`L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The
internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`—we simply compare this
quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in
the *limit state function* `g_break`:

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit
state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### **q2** Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability
as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

``` r
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
df_samples %>%
  mutate(g = map_dbl(strength, g_break)) %>%
  summarize(POF = mean(g <= 0))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##     POF
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1     0

``` r
df_samples %>%
  pull(strength) %>%
  length()
```

    ## [1] 25

**Observations**:

- Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
  - Yes as the POF is 0
- Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or why
  not?
  - No. There are only 25 samples and there is wide variability in the
    data, and we can’t determine the distribution from just these
    samples. We would need more samples to make the estimate
    trustworthy.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.
  - No, since the estimate of probability of failure is not trustworthy
    because of the variability in strength and the small sample size, we
    cannot confidently conclude that the point of failure is less than
    0.03.

## Material property model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to
model the material property. This will give us the means to draw
“virtual samples” and use those to estimate the POF.

### **q3** Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a
`lognormal` distribution; if you didn’t know that fact, then the choice
of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to
specify a lognormal distribution.

``` r
## TODO:

df_fit <- df_samples %>%
  pull(strength) %>%
  fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
  tidy()
df_fit
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 3
    ##   term    estimate std.error
    ##   <chr>      <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 meanlog 10.6       0.00175
    ## 2 sdlog    0.00875   0.00124

Once you’ve successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate
the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted
distribution.

### **q4** Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and
`e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a
lognormal distribution.

``` r
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
n_monte_carlo <- 10000

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- df_fit$estimate[1]
strength_sdlog <- df_fit$estimate[2]

# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
  ## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  mutate(g = g_break(strength)) %>%
  glimpse()
```

    ## Rows: 10,000
    ## Columns: 2
    ## $ strength <dbl> 39539.23, 39811.22, 39785.31, 40094.38, 40362.62, 39638.03, 4…
    ## $ g        <dbl> 323.5441, 595.5327, 569.6273, 878.6938, 1146.9292, 422.3396, …

``` r
#
## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   pof_lo pof_est pof_hi
    ##    <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>
    ## 1 0.0144  0.0169 0.0194

- Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined
  above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced
  variability, or both?
  - The estimate exhibits both induced variability due to the Monte
    Carlo sampling, and the real variability because the original
    samples themselves exhibited real variability.
- Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
  - Yes, the confidence interval implies that POF is less than 0.03
    because the entire confidence interval is below 0.03.
- Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or
  less trustworthy?
  - Compared to the estimate from q2 it is more trustworthy because
    there are many more samples and the confidence interval has an
    estimate of uncertainty associated with it, and they still lie below
    0.03.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
  - Yes, because the mean and standard deviation and therefore the
    confidence interval is generated from the Monte Carlo samples.
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - No, because the mean and standard deviation and therefore the
    confidence interval is still dependent upon the original 25 samples.
- What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
  - Increase the number of samples
- Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - The confidence interval still does not account for the uncertainty
    arising from the real variability from the original samples or the
    limited number of samples.

## A different way to compute the POF

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it
introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple
problem we’re studying, we can compute the probability directly using
the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since
`S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we
can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte
Carlo as
`POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`.
Let’s combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the
POF.

### **q5** Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- plnorm(L/A, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

    ## [1] 0.01832289

**Observations**:

- How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
  - The estimate is very close to the Monte Carlo estimate above but
    does not have an uncertainty estimate associated with it.
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
  approximation*? Why or why not?
  - No because it is not using Monte Carlo approximation to generate the
    estimate
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
  approximation* be induced or real?
  - It would be induced because the Monte Carlo approximation is what
    would cause the uncertainty
- Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical
  tests*? Why or why not?
  - Yes, the mean and standard deviation is still based on the 25
    physical samples, so the estimate has uncertainty due to the limited
    physical tests.
- With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited
  physical tests* be induced or real?
  - The uncertainty due to limited physical tests is induced because
    it’s a result of the limited number of tests, which can be changed,
    rather than a physical property of the material.

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have
uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT
approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with
`plnorm()` we can’t use a CLT approximation because it does not follow
the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it’s not a sum of iid
random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a
confidence interval via resampling.

### **q6** The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 6
    ##   term   .lower .estimate .upper .alpha .method   
    ##   <chr>   <dbl>     <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>     
    ## 1 pof   0.00124    0.0181 0.0510   0.05 percentile

**Observations**:

- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
  - No, because the Monte Carlo approximation is not being used
- Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
  from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
  - No, the confidence interval above does not account for uncertainty
    arising from limited physical tests because the uncertainty is still
    dependent on the number of samples which has not changed.
- Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
  - No, because the upper bound of the confidence interval is above
    0.03, so part of the confidence interval lies above 0.03.
